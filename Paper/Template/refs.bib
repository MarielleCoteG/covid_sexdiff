%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%% authors
% ~ must be separated by "and" (no matter how many there are)
% ~ no {{double brackets}}
% ~ all of the "Firstname Lastname" "Lastname, Firstname" and "Lastname, F." formats can be used, but to prevent issues in the alphabetical sorting in the final document, only one of them should be used consistently

%%%%%%% titles
% ~ automatically lowercase except for the first letter, all other capitalization will be ignored
% ~ to override this rule, use {{Double Brackets}} around the title or brackets around the {L}etter to be capitalized

%%%%%%% misc
% ~ non-breaking space is, as in the normal LaTeX document, "~"
% ~ if one journal is cited many times and you don't want to keep typing the whole title, choose an abbreviation and use this function
@string{jot = "Journal of Trees"}
