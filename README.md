# Sex differences in COVID-19 mortality in the United States : A state-level analysis

Male mortality due to COVID-19 has been found to be higher than women's due to a combination of biological and behavioural factors. The United States has been one of the countries most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with large variations at the state and county levels in infection and mortality rates. In this paper, we assess sex differentials in COVID-19 mortality across US states and compare them with sex differentials in all-cause mortality, as well as six leading causes of death. We establish the male disadvantage in COVID-19 mortality, which is systematically higher than for all-cause mortality. We also describe the trajectory of male-to-female COVID-19 mortality ratios across ages, showing that male disadvantage decreases significantly in the 85+ age group. Although there is some convergence between states as age increases, Western states consistently exhibit the largest male excess mortality, and Southern States, the lowest.
